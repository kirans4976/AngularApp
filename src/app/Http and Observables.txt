we will use http request for sending request and we get http responce

as an observable and we need cast observable as an array of employees

newspaper ex:

newspaper company send req to source fro geeting data,after getting data it modifies to specific
format and send to the houses that only subscribered the newspaper

Observables:

A sequence of items that arrive asynchronously over time
Http call - single items
single item - http responce

here http call is single item, in angular observables is an single item that arrives asynvhronously
as we receive responce as an observable, it is not suitable for using readly, hence we need to convert
the observable into employee array & provide the data to the subscribered components to the employee service

http observable & RXjs 

1.http get request  from emp service
2.receive the observable & cast it into an employee  array
3.subscribe to the observable to the employeelist & empdetail
4.assign the emp to the local variable 
RXJS:
reactive extensions for js
external library to work with observables

angular 5 has httpclient instead of httpModule
add httpClentModule in imprts od appmodule & we doesn't add httpservice in providers because
httpclientModule will take care of this
